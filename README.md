# 11winds = 11ty + TailwindCSS

**Demo**: <a href="https://11winds.io" target="_blank">11winds.io</a>

11winds is a simple boilerplate. It combines the static site generator <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a> with the CSS framework <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>. It minifies and purges the CSS file (so it boiles down the TailwindCSS file to a few kb, based on your usage) and comes with a static server and browser sync support for your local development.
